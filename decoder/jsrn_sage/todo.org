Work to do on codinglib

* Rename project
* Code
** Rename Code to BlockCode
Since we assume that its mono-alphabetic and linear (has generator matrix)
** Support for Poly-alphabetic codes
*** Contains CRT codes
*** Ideal Codes
** Code: decode function which is the inverse of encode
* Interleaved codes
** General framework for Interleaving of codes
** Problems
*** Support easy overriding of default construction if specialised is helpful
*** Automatic extension of decoding algorithm?
* Encoding/Decoding algorithms
** Should be general/pluggable/choosable in some way
** Should still be easy/automatic when one is not interested in choice
